This plugin allows administrators who want to feature and link to news articles to register news feeds, select articles from those feeds and post them as items on a blog.  This is intended for link blogging, primarily.  Uses WP meta fields to create special records including a teaser title, image, image credit, link to the original article and a blurb about the article which you can then display as you like on your site.  Note that special instructions for how to use meta should come from the WordPress.org support pages on the subject.
